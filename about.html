      <h1 class="aboutpageheaders">The Label</h1>
      <p>DMZ are a record label and club night operating out of south London. Comprised of the Digital Mystikz (who produce individually as Mala and Coki), Loefah and MC Sgt. Pokes, their chest rattling beats irrevocably changed the face of
        electronic music in the mid-2000s.
        <br>
        <br>
        Started in 2004, the label side of DMZ became arguably the most enduring label within the dubstep scene. The label's output was smaller than many of the other contemporary dubstep labels, and the music
        itself was produced only by the 'members' of the crew, barring VIPs and Remixes. As a result, each release took on its own flavour, with the artists personalities and tastes shining through the various permutations of sub heavy beats. It is a
        testament to the quality of the music that
        a label with such a narrow focus went on to become the phenomenon that it did.
        <br>
        <br>
        DMZ releases like Loefah"s "Horror Show" (DMZ002), Mala"s "Anti-War Dub" and Coki"s "Haunted" (DMZ006) provided anthems to a burgeoinging scene, and their popularity pushed the "dubstep" sound out of south London and into the global
        electronic music scene.

      <p>As people"s idea of what constitutes Dubstep began to solidify, each producer continued to hone in on their own unique take on the sound. Following "Haunted," Coki began to push the warping, aggressive basslines that would become the
        defining and perhaps most maligned aspect of the genre in years to come. But Coki did so with a refinement lacking in a number of his imitators, using the basslines in conjunction with reggae/dub elements that tamed their insanity, even if
        only slightly. Loefah, who began Dubstep"s turn towards the
        sparse
        "halfstep" style drums, continued to churn out minimal, but weighty cuts, sprinkled lovingly with 808 percussion and industrial blasts of reverb-soaked growls. Mala, whose music had always been the most melodic of the three, continued to
        release his mystical, organic take on the sound, rife with world percussion and acoustic instruments. He has also taken the steps to nurture new talent in the scene, launching his own "Deep Medi" with heavyweight cuts like Kromestar"s
        "Kalawanji" or his own "Changes."

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>DMZ has been described as one of dubstep"s two "most influential regular clubnight[s]" (with its predecessor FWD>> as the other one) and "central to the scene". Starting in March 2005, with minimal flyers stating the lineup, time location,
        bearing the slogan "come meditate on bass weight". The DMZ nights themselves followed this minimal aesthetic. Originally held at Mass in Brixton, the nights featured minimal fanfare, just a large soundsystem and a blue light to illuminate the
        smokey haze of the dancefloor.

      <br>
      The night"s attendance increased steadily. BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs, discovered dubstep under the blue lights at DMZ. Entranced by the seemingly boundless energy within the scene, she described her experience as "The most inspirational
      experience I've had in a club in 10 years." Her
      involvement in the scene would eventually lead to the 2006 radio show "Dubstep Warz", part of her Breezeblock show on the BBC, a broadcast that would cause the dubstep scene to absolutely explode in popularity. It is no surprise that, At the
      DMZ first anniversary party, held only two months after Dubstep Warz,
      a queue of 600 people forced Mass to move the party from its regular 400-capacity space to the club"s main room, a landmark moment for both DMZ and Dubstep as a whole.
      <br>
      <br>
      Eventually, as all things must, the regular DMZ clubnights came to an end. Still, though, they happen infrequently, to celebrate the anniversary of the original night. These nights are marquee events for the surviving dubstep scene, selling
      out nearly instantly and featuring lineups worthy of a festival.
