      <h1>The Label</h1>
      <p>DMZ are a record label and club night operating out of south London. Comprised of the Digital Mystikz (who produce individually as Mala and Coki), Loefah and MC Sgt. Pokes, their chest rattling beats have irrevocably changed the face of
        electronic music in the mid-2000s.
      </p>

      <p>DMZ Plates such as Loefah"s "Horror Show" (DMZ002), Mala"s "Anti-War Dub" and Coki"s "Haunted" (DMZ006) provided anthems to a burgeoinging scene, and their popularity pushed the "dubstep" sound out of south London and into the global
        electronic music scene. </p>

      <p>As people"s idea of what constitutes Dubstep began to solidify, each producer continued to hone in on their own unique take on the sound. Following "Haunted," Coki began to push the warping, aggressive basslines that would plague the genre
        for
        years to come, but did so with a refinement lacking in a number of his imitators, using the basslines in conjunction with reggae/dub elements that tamed their insanity, even if only slightly. Loefah, who began Dubstep"s turn towards the
        sparse
        "halfstep" style drums, continued to churn out minimal, but weighty cuts, sprinkled lovingly with 808 percussion and industrial blasts of reverb-soaked growls. Mala, whose music had always been the most melodic of the three, continued to
        release his mystical, organic take on the sound, rife with world percussion and acoustic instruments. He has also taken the steps to nurture new talent in the scene, launching his own "Deep Medi" with heavyweight cuts like Kromestar"s
        "Kalawanji" or his own "Changes."

      <h1>The Night</h1>

      <br>
      <p>DMZ has been described as one of dubstep"s two "most influential regular clubnight[s]" (with its predecessor FWD>> as the other one) and "central to the scene". Starting in March 2005, with minimal flyers stating the lineup, time location,
        bearing the slogan "come meditate on bass weight". The DMZ nights themselves followed this minimal aesthetic. Originally held at Mass in Brixton, the nights featured minimal fanfare, just a large soundsystem and a blue light to illuminate the
        smokey haze of the dancefloor.
        <br>
        <br>
        The night"s attendance increased steadily. BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs, discovered dubstep under the blue lights at DMZ. Entranced by the seemingly boundless energy within the scene, she described her experience as "The most inspirational
        experience I've had in a club in 10 years." Her
        involvement in the scene would eventually lead to the 2006 radio show "Dubstep Warz", part of her Breezeblock show on the BBC, a broadcast that would cause the dubstep scene to absolutely explode in popularity. It is no surprise that, At the
        DMZ first anniversary party, held only two months after Dubstep Warz,
        a queue of 600 people forced Mass to move the party from its regular 400-capacity space to the club"s main room, a landmark moment for both DMZ and Dubstep as a whole.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eventually, as all things must, the regular DMZ clubnights came to an end. Still, though, they happen infrequently, to celebrate the anniversary of the original night. These nights are marquee events for the surviving dubstep scene, selling
        out nearly instantly and featuring lineups worthy of a festival.
